                specific url you can push to
        git push origin master
        git pull origin master

/// Git remote ////////////
        git remote -v: will show you your remotes so you can get hold of the url, 
        git remote rm origin: will remove it, 
        git remote add origin <url>: will re-add it.

//Previous problems

I could not merge becuaes of unrelated histories of the file. This usually happens
you create a git repository WITH a README.md, then pull to a local repostory. 
Solution: Delete the local files and clone the files from git hub to your repository 

// To remove the git init files
remote git init files:
        rm -rf .git 

//If you type git log it will set you in VIM. To get out type ':q'
